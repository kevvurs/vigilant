# Vigilant
## About
Vigilant is a microservice designed to run on Google AppEngine. It is a component
of an upcoming news webapp [over at alpha](https://github.com/kevvurs/alpha).
Vigilant is meant to support the main app by aggregating content
from Google News. This app persists data to a Google CLoud SQL instance for the
main app to use.
## Vision
My goal is to build a larger media website for news that emphasizes user interaction.
The main app will provide content and manage the database of content, some of which
will be user-generated. I will give more details over on the alpha project at a
later date.
